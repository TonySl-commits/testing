"""
This module contains a class for prompt properties used in generating PDF reports.
The `PromptProperties` class is responsible for storing properties used to generate
a PDF report. This class uses the `CDR_Properties` class to get the properties from
the `cdr_trace.properties` file.

Attributes:
prompt (dict): A dictionary of dictionaries. The keys of the outer dictionary are the names of the prompts.
The keys of the inner dictionary are the names of the titles of the report. Each topic has a systemprompt,
user prompt and figure if it exists.

The system prompts are edited underneath their definition within the class. Whereas the user prompts are
given their values to the object defined in aoi_report_functions.py. 

This architecture allows the pdg_report_generator to tackle each topic and generate a response from the groq model.
This allows flexibility in terms of prompt engineering to get the desired output

In the case that a second approach was desired in which one request is sent to the groq model per device, then the
system prompts and user prompts should be merged in a single dictionary and read by the groq model. This will make
less requests to the model but at the cost of larger more complicated prompts

                A higher score indicates that the data is consistently available throughout the specified timeframe, 
                allowing for reliable trend analysis and pattern identification.
            2. Hour of Day Consistency: This metric assesses the consistency of data recording throughout the day, 
                ensuring that data points are evenly distributed across different hours throughout the specified period of time. 
                A higher score indicates that data is consistently collected throughout the day, enabling accurate temporal analysis and insights into a personâ€™s trajectories, 
                stay-points or areas of interest during a day.
            3. Day of Week Consistency: This metric measures the consistency of data recording across different days of the week. 
                A higher score indicates that data is consistently available across all days of the week, 
                facilitating comparative analysis between weekdays and weekends and providing valuable insights into user behavior.
            4. Hits Per Day Consistency: This metric evaluates the consistency of activity levels recorded per day, 
                providing insights into user behavior patterns over time. A higher score indicates that activity levels are consistently recorded each day, 
                offering valuable insights into user behavior patterns and enabling more accurate analysis and decision-making.
